## ðŸš€ Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Uber Fares dataset to uncover key insights about fare patterns, ride times, and operational metrics. Specific objectives include:

- Understanding the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaning and transforming the dataset using Python (Pandas)
- Enhancing the data with new analytical features
- Importing the enhanced dataset into Power BI for visualization
- Designing an interactive dashboard that highlights fare behavior across time and geography
- Presenting actionable insights for stakeholders

---

### 3. ðŸ§  Feature Engineering
- Extracted `pickup_hour`, `pickup_day`, `pickup_month`, `pickup_dayofweek`.
- Calculated `trip_distance_km` using haversine formula.
- Exported enhanced dataset (`uber_enhanced.csv`).

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion and Recommendations

### âœ… **Conclusion**
This project provided valuable insights into Uber's ride fare dynamics by combining data preprocessing in Python with powerful data visualizations in Power BI. Key findings include:

- **Peak hours** (especially 7â€“9 AM and 4â€“7 PM) had a higher volume of rides, as expected.
- **Fare amounts** varied by time of day and day of the week, showing patterns that can inform pricing and operational decisions.
- **Trip distance** positively correlated with fare amount, but outliers highlighted potential issues in data entry or GPS recording.
- The addition of engineered features (like trip distance in km and temporal breakdowns) significantly enhanced the analytical depth.

### ðŸ’¡ **Recommendations**
- **For Uber Analysts:** Use these insights to optimize driver deployment during high-demand hours and areas.
- **For Data Teams:** Clean data further by eliminating outliers and validating GPS coordinates to improve reliability.
- **For Future Work:** Integrate external datasets such as weather or traffic data to explain fare anomalies and better predict demand.
- **For Learning:** This project showcases how Python and Power BI can be effectively combined for real-world analyticsâ€”encouraging continued practice in feature engineering and visualization design.
