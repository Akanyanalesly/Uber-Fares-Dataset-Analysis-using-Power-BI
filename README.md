## ðŸš€ Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Uber Fares dataset to uncover key insights about fare patterns, ride times, and operational metrics. Specific objectives include:

- Understanding the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaning and transforming the dataset using Python (Pandas)
- Enhancing the data with new analytical features
- Importing the enhanced dataset into Power BI for visualization
- Designing an interactive dashboard that highlights fare behavior across time and geography
- Presenting actionable insights for stakeholders

## ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. ðŸ“¥ Data Collection & Loading
- Downloaded Uber dataset from Kaggle.
- Loaded into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
- Explored the structure, data types, null values, and duplicate rows.

---

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values and extreme outliers (fare, distance).
- Converted timestamps into proper datetime objects.

---

### 3. ðŸ§  Feature Engineering
- Extracted `pickup_hour`, `pickup_day`, `pickup_month`, `pickup_dayofweek`.
- Calculated `trip_distance_km` using haversine formula.
- Exported enhanced dataset (`uber_enhanced.csv`).

### 4. ðŸ“Š Power BI Analysis

#### Visual 1: Number of Rides by Hour of Day
- Chart Type: Clustered Column
- Axis: `pickup_hour`
- Values: Count of `fare_amount`

![Ride Count by Hour](visuals/ride_count_by_hour.png)

#### Visual 2: Average Fare by Hour
- Chart Type: Clustered Column
- Axis: `pickup_hour`
- Values: Average of `fare_amount`

![Average Fare by Hour](visuals/avg_fare_by_hour.png)

#### Visual 3: Fare Distribution by Day of Week
- Chart Type: Clustered Bar Chart (Box plot not available)
- Axis: `pickup_dayofweek`
- Values: `fare_amount`

![Fare by Day of Week](visuals/fare_by_day_of_week.png)

#### Visual 4: Scatter Plot (Fare vs Trip Distance)
- Chart Type: Scatter Plot
- X-Axis: `trip_distance_km`
- Y-Axis: `fare_amount`
- Details: `passenger_count` (optional)

![Scatter Fare vs Distance](visuals/scatter_fare_vs_distance.png)

#### Visual 5: Pickup Locations Map (Alternative)
- Used: Line and Stacked Column Chart due to map unavailability

### 5. ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Design
- Unified visuals into interactive layout.
- Added slicers for time filters (hour, day, month).
- Formatted chart titles, colors, and tooltips.
